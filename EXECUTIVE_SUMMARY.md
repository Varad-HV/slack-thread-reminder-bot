## 💡 Real-World Value

### Scenario 1: Recognize High Performers
```
Dashboard shows @john with ⭐4.8 efficiency
→ You recognize him in team standup
→ He feels valued & performs better
```

### Scenario 2: Unblock Stuck Work
```
Dashboard shows "SDK bug" with 16 pings in limbo
→ You click "View Thread" link (in CSV)
→ Jump directly to Slack
→ Offer to help or reassign
→ Ticket gets unstuck
```

### Scenario 3: Fix Process Issues
```
Analytics show 67% of reports are "Invalid"
→ You realize team doesn't understand bot rules
→ Send email clarifying proper use
→ Next month: Invalid reports drop to 20%
→ Bot health improves
```

### Scenario 4: Balance Workload
```
Workload view shows Sarah has 5 tasks, Mike has 1
→ You ask Mike if he wants one of Sarah's
→ Work gets distributed fairly
→ Next sprint: Everyone balanced
```
